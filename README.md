This repo gives insights into:
1. How to develop a simple webapp using FAST API
2. How to deploy it and run within a lamba with API gateway integration.
3. How to package the entire code in a docker image and run the image in a lambda function
4. How to deploy this entire solution easily using SAM. 

See my article for detailed description.
